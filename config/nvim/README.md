# Neovim Config

Minimal config for Neovim 0.12+ using `vim.pack`.

## Setup

Chezmoi manages this Neovim config and `~/.config/mise/config.toml`.

On machines with `mise` installed, chezmoi automatically runs:

```bash
mise install --yes --cd "$HOME"
```

That installs the LSP servers and formatters expected by `init.lua`, including
LuaLS, Pyright, Ruff, rust-analyzer, rustfmt, Stylua, Prettier, Zig, ZLS, and
Tree-sitter.
